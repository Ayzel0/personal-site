            <p>I'm from Austin, Texas and currently live in DC. I started web development around 2 months ago while I was sick on a family vacation. I love making things - I cook and knit - and would love to pursue new opportunities in the software engineering, web development, or cybersecurity sphere. <br /><br />Here are some of the languages and tools that I'm currently using/have used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>React.js</li>
                <li>Pandas and NumPy</li>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
                <li>ES6</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
